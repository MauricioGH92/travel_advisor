# Travel Advisor

This project lists tourist places such as hotels, restaurants and attraction centers. Initially, location permissions must be given so that by default it lists the tourist places of the device's location, otherwise it will place it in Guayaquil..

## Features

- intelligent search box by name of the city and country.
- filters by type and score range.
- Interaction between the map and the list: when clicking on a letter on the map, the list scrolls until it finds the description of the tourist place.

## Technologies and services
The application is developed with react and connects to services such as rapidapi and google maps, so you have to obtain the keys from these testers.
